        <p>About Me
Hello, my name is Cahliel, and I'm a Roblox developer who specializes in scripting. I am 24 and I have been working with Roblox for quite a while. I can script just about anything. Even if I don't have experience with what you're asking for. As long as I can find an example or guide I can get it done. I'm currently working on a new upcoming game called Chainsawman Devils Domain as the team's lead scripter.
<br>
Why Me?
<br>
I will provide professional communication and you’ll always be able to reach me. I have a good amount of experience and have built systems from scratch as well. I give quality work and leave comments explaining what does what and will write the code so that it's easy for you to customize! I will never say I can't do something and not try. I will do research and figure out how to get the job done.
